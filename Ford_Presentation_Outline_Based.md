## Slide 4: Revenue & Profitability

# **1. Revenue & Profitability Trends**

## Key Findings:
- **Revenue Range:** $127B (2020 pandemic) to $185B (2024 high)

## Strong Cash Generation:
- **Operating Cash Flow:** $15-25B range (avg $16.4B)
- **Capex:** $6-8B annually (increasing for EV)
- **Free Cash Flow:** Positive 9/10 years, total $91.7B

## Key Insights:
- Cash flow remains strong even in loss years

## Slide 6: Balance Sheet & Debt

# **3. Balance Sheet & Debt Structure**

## Asset & Debt Evolution:
- **Total Assets:** $225B (2015) → $285B (2024)
- **Total Debt:** $150-160B range (mostly Ford Credit)
- **Cash Holdings:** Peak $25B+ (2020-21), Current $22.9B

## Important Context:
- Debt appears high but mostly financing operations
- Ford Credit ≠ Automotive debt
- Strong cash cushion maintained

## Recommendations:
✓ Maintain **$20B+ cash reserves**  
✓ **Gradual de-leveraging** of Automotive debt  
✓ Diversify Ford Credit funding sources

## Slide 7: Liquidity & Leverage

# **4. Liquidity & Leverage Metrics**

## Current Position:
- **Current Ratio:** 1.16 (2024) - adequate but tight
- **Debt-to-Equity:** 3.5x (inflated by Ford Credit)
- **Interest Coverage:** Improved but vulnerable

## Historical Range:
- Current Ratio: 1.16 - 1.25
- D/E Ratio: 2.8x - 5.2x
- Weak coverage in crisis years (2019, 2020, 2022)

## Recommendations:
✓ Improve **working capital management**  
✓ Target current ratio > 1.2  
✓ Better communicate Ford Credit impact on ratios

## Slide 8: Key Risks & Patterns

# **5. Key Risks & Strategic Patterns**

## Major Risks Identified:
🔴 **Ford Credit dependency** inflates leverage appearance  
🔴 **Cyclical profitability** - vulnerable to downturns  
🔴 **EV transition costs** - heavy spending, uncertain returns  
🔴 **Thin margins** - little room for execution errors

## Strategic Patterns:
- Pivot to trucks/SUVs (higher margin)
- Aggressive EV investment despite pressure
- International restructuring
- Ford Pro expansion (stable revenue)

## Recommendations:
✓ Strengthen **quality control** to avoid recall costs  
✓ Accelerate **EV adoption via Ford Pro** (fleets)  
✓ Strategic partnerships for **battery/charging**
