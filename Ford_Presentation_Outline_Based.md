### Historical Foundation:
- **Founded:** 1903 by Henry Ford
- **2024 Revenue:** $185 billion
- **Global Presence:** Operations in 100+ countries

### Three-Business Strategy:
- **Ford Blue:** Optimize traditional ICE vehicles for cash generation
- **Ford Model e:** Scale electric vehicle investments for growth  
- **Ford Pro:** Leverage commercial solutions for stability
- **Ford Credit:** Financing services

### **Transformation Success:**
- 2021: $17.9B net income validated EV strategy
- Sustained profitability recovery through focused execution

---

## Slide 4: Revenue & Profitability

# **1. Revenue & Profitability: Three-Phase Journey**

## **Phase 1 (2015-2018): Declining Performance**
- Operating margins: 4.7% → 2.0% (crisis point)
- Unfocused product portfolio, competitive pressure
- **Catalyst for 2018 strategic restructuring**

## **Phase 2 (2018-2020): Strategic Pivot** 
- Bold segmentation into Blue/Model e/Pro
- Pandemic disruption masks transformation benefits
- Strategic positioning despite temporary losses

## **Phase 3 (2021-2024): Transformation Payoff**
- **2021 vindication:** $17.9B net income (EV strategy value)
- Sustained recovery: 2024 revenue at $185B all-time high
- Segmentation strategy proves prescient

## Strategic Outcomes:
✓ **Portfolio optimization** via business unit focus  
✓ **EV investment transparency** through Model e separation  
✓ **Commercial expansion** via Ford Pro growth

## Slide 5: Cash Flow & Capital Expenditure

# **2. Cash Flow & Capex Analysis**

## Strong Cash Generation:
- **Operating Cash Flow:** $15-25B range (avg $16.4B)
- **Capex:** $6-8B annually (increasing for EV)
- **Free Cash Flow:** Positive 9/10 years, total $91.7B

## Key Insights:
- Cash flow remains strong even in loss years
- FCF funds investments internally
- Rising capex reflects EV transition

## Recommendations:
✓ Maintain **disciplined Capex allocation**  
✓ Balance EV investments with profitable ICE platforms  
✓ Increase **transparency on EV ROI milestones**

## Slide 6: Balance Sheet & Debt

# **3. Balance Sheet & Debt Structure**

## Asset & Debt Evolution:
- **Total Assets:** $225B (2015) → $285B (2024)
- **Total Debt:** $150-160B range (mostly Ford Credit)
- **Cash Holdings:** Peak $25B+ (2020-21), Current $22.9B

## Important Context:
- Debt appears high but mostly financing operations
- Ford Credit ≠ Automotive debt
- Strong cash cushion maintained

## Recommendations:
✓ Maintain **$20B+ cash reserves**  
✓ **Gradual de-leveraging** of Automotive debt  
✓ Diversify Ford Credit funding sources

**[Visual: Stacked area - Assets, Debt, Cash trends]**

## Slide 7: Liquidity & Leverage

# **4. Liquidity & Leverage Metrics**

## Current Position:
- **Current Ratio:** 1.16 (2024) - adequate but tight
- **Debt-to-Equity:** 3.5x (inflated by Ford Credit)
- **Interest Coverage:** Improved but vulnerable

## Historical Range:
- Current Ratio: 1.16 - 1.25
- D/E Ratio: 2.8x - 5.2x
- Weak coverage in crisis years (2019, 2020, 2022)

## Recommendations:
✓ Improve **working capital management**  
✓ Target current ratio > 1.2  
✓ Better communicate Ford Credit impact on ratios

## Slide 8: Key Risks & Patterns

# **5. Strategic Evolution & Risk Management**

## **2018 Restructuring: Strategic Response to Crisis**
- **Root Cause:** Deteriorating margins, unfocused portfolio
- **Solution:** Three-business segmentation for clarity
- **Execution:** Different strategies for each business reality

## **Strategic Patterns Post-Restructuring:**
- **Ford Blue:** Optimized ICE portfolio (exit sedans, focus trucks/SUVs)
- **Ford Model e:** Aggressive EV investment with transparent tracking
- **Ford Pro:** Commercial focus targeting stable, less price-sensitive customers
- **Organizational Discipline:** Maintained distinct business unit boundaries

## **Risk Mitigation Through Segmentation:**
✓ **Portfolio Risk:** Focused each unit on core competencies  
✓ **Investment Risk:** Clear EV ROI tracking via Model e separation  
✓ **Market Risk:** Ford Pro provides counter-cyclical stability  
✓ **Execution Risk:** Specialized management for each business model

## **Ongoing Challenges:**
- Maintain business unit discipline while capturing synergies
- Scale Model e to profitability while preserving Blue cash generation
