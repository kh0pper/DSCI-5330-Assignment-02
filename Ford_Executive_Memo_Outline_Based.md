**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Financial Analysis Team  
**DATE:** September 19, 2025  
**RE:** Ford Motor Company - 10-Year Financial Analysis (2015-2024) and Investment Recommendation

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum presents our comprehensive analysis of Ford Motor Company's financial performance over the past decade (2015-2024), examining key balance sheet trends, financial statement patterns, and providing investment recommendations. Our analysis reveals a company with resilient cash generation and strong franchises, but facing thin margins and cyclical profitability challenges as it navigates the transition to electric vehicles.

## COMPANY INTRODUCTION

Ford Motor Company stands as one of America's iconic automotive manufacturers, with a 122-year history of innovation and market leadership. The company underwent a pivotal transformation in 2018, restructuring into three distinct business units: Ford Blue (traditional ICE vehicles), Ford Model e (electric vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial solutions), alongside Ford Credit (financing services). This strategic reorganization was a direct response to declining profitability and the industry's shift toward electrification, enabling Ford to optimize its mature ICE business while investing strategically in growth opportunities. With revenues approaching $185 billion in 2024, Ford has successfully navigated this transformation to maintain its position as a global automotive powerhouse.

## DETAILED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### 1. Revenue & Profitability

**Key Observations:**
- Revenue fluctuated between **$127B (2020 pandemic low)** and **$185B (2024 high)**, demonstrating both vulnerability to economic shocks and strong recovery capability
- **Margins remain thin**: Operating income rarely exceeds $6-7B, with operating margins averaging only 2.4%
- **2021 was an outlier**: Net income surged to **$17.9B** due to special items including pension remeasurement and investment gains (notably Rivian)

**Table 1: Revenue & Profitability Trends (2015-2024)**

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Gross Margin % | Operating Margin % | Net Margin % | Net Income ($B) |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 2015 | 149.6 | 16.8 | 4.7 | 4.9 | 7.4 |
| 2016 | 151.8 | 16.9 | 3.8 | 3.0 | 4.6 |
| 2017 | 156.8 | 16.2 | 3.1 | 4.9 | 7.6 |
| 2018 | 160.3 | 15.0 | 2.0 | 2.3 | 3.7 |
| 2019 | 155.9 | 13.6 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.8 |
| 2020 | 127.1 | 11.3 | -3.5 | -1.0 | -1.3 |
| 2021 | 136.3 | 15.9 | 3.3 | 13.1 | 17.9 |
| 2022 | 158.1 | 15.0 | 4.0 | -1.4 | -2.2 |
| 2023 | 176.2 | 14.6 | 3.1 | 2.5 | 4.3 |
| 2024 | 185.0 | 14.4 | 2.8 | 3.2 | 5.9 |

**Pattern Analysis:**
The decade reveals three distinct phases in Ford's profitability journey:

**Phase 1 (2015-2018): Declining Performance** - Operating margins deteriorated from 4.7% to 2.0% as Ford struggled with an unfocused product portfolio and increasing competitive pressure. This period culminated in the critical 2018 strategic restructuring.

**Phase 2 (2018-2020): Strategic Pivot** - Ford's bold segmentation into Blue/Model e/Pro enabled focused resource allocation but coincided with pandemic disruption, creating temporary losses while positioning for long-term success.

**Phase 3 (2021-2024): Transformation Payoff** - The restructuring strategy proved prescient, with 2021's exceptional results ($17.9B including EV-related gains) demonstrating the value of strategic EV investments, followed by sustained profitability recovery.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue **focusing on higher-margin vehicles** (trucks, SUVs, and commercial) while simplifying low-margin product lines
- Greater emphasis on **software and service revenue** (connected vehicles, subscriptions) can boost margins beyond the cyclical auto core
- Leverage the strength of F-Series and Transit franchises to maintain pricing power

### 2. Cash Flow & Capital Expenditure

**Key Observations:**
- **Operating cash flow remained strong** most years, ranging from $6.8B to $24.3B, averaging $16.4B annually
- **Capex averaged $7.2B annually**, with recent increases to $8.7B reflecting heavy EV and restructuring investments
- **Free Cash Flow stayed positive** in 9 out of 10 years, totaling $91.7B over the decade, demonstrating Ford's ability to fund investments internally

**Table 2: Cash Flow & Capital Expenditure Analysis (2015-2024)**

| Year | Operating Cash Flow ($B) | Capex ($B) | Free Cash Flow ($B) | Cash & Equivalents ($B) |
|------|--------------------------|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 2015 | 16.2 | 7.2 | 9.0 | 4.0 |
| 2016 | 19.8 | 7.0 | 12.9 | 3.0 |
| 2017 | 18.1 | 7.0 | 11.0 | 3.5 |
| 2018 | 15.0 | 7.8 | 7.2 | 2.7 |
| 2019 | 17.6 | 7.6 | 10.0 | 17.5 |
| 2020 | 24.3 | 5.7 | 18.5 | 25.2 |
| 2021 | 15.8 | 6.2 | 9.6 | 20.5 |
| 2022 | 6.8 | 6.9 | -0.0 | 25.1 |
| 2023 | 14.9 | 8.2 | 6.7 | 24.9 |
| 2024 | 15.4 | 8.7 | 6.7 | 22.9 |

**Pattern Analysis:**
Despite profitability challenges, Ford consistently generates robust operating cash flow, even during loss years. This cash generation capability provides crucial flexibility for strategic investments and weathering economic downturns.

**Recommendations:**
- Maintain **disciplined Capex allocation** by balancing EV investments with sustaining profitable ICE/Hybrid platforms
- Increase transparency on **EV ROI milestones** (e.g., break-even timing for Model e) to reassure investors that cash flow is being reinvested effectively
- Target free cash flow of $9-11B annually to support both transformation investments and shareholder returns

### 3. Balance Sheet & Debt Management

**Key Observations:**
- Total assets grew from **$225B in 2015** to **$285B in 2024**, a 27% increase
- **Debt levels are substantial** ($150-160B range), but most belongs to Ford Credit's financing operations, not core Automotive
- **Cash holdings increased** to $25B+ during crisis years, providing crucial liquidity cushion
- Current cash position of $22.9B (2024) remains healthy

**Table 3: Balance Sheet & Debt Structure (2015-2024)**

| Year | Total Assets ($B) | Total Debt ($B) | Shareholders Equity ($B) | Debt to Equity |
|------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| 2015 | 225 | 133 | 28.7 | 4.6 |
| 2016 | 238 | 143 | 29.2 | 4.9 |
| 2017 | 258 | 154 | 34.9 | 4.4 |
| 2018 | 257 | 154 | 36.0 | 4.3 |
| 2019 | 259 | 155 | 33.2 | 4.7 |
| 2020 | 267 | 161 | 30.8 | 5.2 |
| 2021 | 257 | 138 | 48.6 | 2.8 |
| 2022 | 256 | 139 | 43.2 | 3.2 |
| 2023 | 273 | 149 | 42.8 | 3.5 |
| 2024 | 285 | 159 | 44.9 | 3.5 |

**Pattern Analysis:**
Ford maintains a complex balance sheet structure due to its captive finance arm. While total debt appears high, the separation between Ford Credit and Automotive operations is critical to understanding the company's true leverage position.

**Recommendations:**
- Maintain high cash reserves ($20B+) to offset cyclical swings and fund the EV transition
- Consider **gradual de-leveraging of Automotive debt** (not Ford Credit), which would strengthen investor confidence without hurting lending operations
- Continue diversifying funding sources for Ford Credit to reduce dependency on any single capital market

### 4. Liquidity & Leverage Metrics

**Key Observations:**
- **Current ratios hover near 1.0-1.2**, adequate but not strong by traditional standards
- **Debt-to-equity appears high** (3.5x in 2024, ranging 2.8x-5.2x), but this is inflated by Ford Credit's financing model
- Interest coverage has improved but showed weakness during crisis years (below 2x in 2019, 2020, 2022)

**Table 4: Liquidity & Leverage Ratios (2015-2024)**

| Year | Current Ratio | Interest Coverage | ROE % | ROA % |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------|-------|
| 2015 | 1.25 | 14.3 | 25.7 | 3.3 |
| 2016 | 1.20 | 8.6 | 15.8 | 1.9 |
| 2017 | 1.23 | 8.2 | 21.8 | 3.0 |
| 2018 | 1.20 | 3.5 | 10.3 | 1.4 |
| 2019 | 1.16 | 0.6 | 2.5 | 0.3 |
| 2020 | 1.20 | 0.5 | -4.2 | -0.5 |
| 2021 | 1.20 | 10.9 | 36.8 | 7.0 |
| 2022 | 1.20 | -1.4 | -5.0 | -0.8 |
| 2023 | 1.20 | 4.1 | 10.1 | 1.6 |
| 2024 | 1.16 | 7.5 | 13.1 | 2.1 |

**Pattern Analysis:**
Liquidity metrics suggest Ford operates with relatively tight working capital, which is typical for automotive manufacturers but requires careful management during downturns.

**Recommendations:**
- Improve liquidity by tightening **working capital management**, particularly inventory turnover and receivables collection
- Target current ratio above 1.2 to provide additional cushion
- Continue diversifying Ford Credit funding to protect against rising rates or credit market stress

### 5. Key Risks & Strategic Patterns

**Identified Risks:**
- Heavy dependence on **Ford Credit** makes leverage ratios appear risky to uninformed observers
- Profitability remains highly **cyclical**: dramatic swings between downturn years (2019-2020, 2022) and recovery periods
- **EV transition spending** is evident in rising Capex and R&D, with uncertain near-term returns
- Thin margins leave little room for error in execution or market disruptions

**Strategic Patterns Observed:**
- **2018 Segmentation Strategy**: The creation of distinct business units (Blue/Model e/Pro) was Ford's strategic response to deteriorating margins and industry transformation
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Clear pivot toward higher-margin products (trucks, SUVs) with elimination of sedan portfolio from North America
- **EV Investment Strategy**: Aggressive investment in electrification through dedicated Model e division, enabling transparent tracking of transformation costs vs. core profitability
- **Commercial Focus**: Ford Pro emergence as a stable revenue generator, targeting less price-sensitive fleet customers with recurring service contracts
- **International Restructuring**: Exit from unprofitable global markets to focus resources on profitable segments

**Recommendations:**
- Strengthen **quality control and recall management**, as unexpected costs have historically hurt margins
- Speed up **EV scale-up** by leveraging Ford Pro (fleets/commercial customers) where early adoption is less price-sensitive
- Partner strategically on **battery supply and charging infrastructure** to reduce risk of high input costs or adoption bottlenecks
- Develop clearer communication strategy around Ford Credit to help investors properly assess leverage

## INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

### Problem Statement
The company is considering two alternative long-term investments:
- **Investment A:** $50 million per year for 20 years
- **Investment B:** $40 million per year for 12 years

### Present Value Analysis

Using the formula for present value of an ordinary annuity:
**PV = C × [(1 - (1+r)^-n) / r]**

Where: C = annual cash inflow, r = discount rate, n = number of years

**Table 5: Investment NPV Analysis Across Discount Rates**

| Discount Rate | Investment A NPV ($M) | Investment B NPV ($M) | NPV Advantage A ($M) |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 5% | 623.1 | 354.5 | 268.6 |
| 8% | 490.9 | 301.4 | 189.5 |
| 10% | 425.7 | 272.5 | 153.1 |
| 12% | 373.5 | 247.8 | 125.7 |
| 15% | 313.0 | 216.8 | 96.1 |

### Investment Recommendation

**We strongly recommend Investment A** based on the following analysis:

1. **Superior Present Value**: Across all reasonable discount rates (5%-15%), Investment A consistently delivers higher present value than Investment B

2. **Strategic Advantages**:
   - **Higher annual cash flow** ($50M vs $40M) provides greater operational flexibility
   - **Longer duration** (20 years vs 12 years) aligns with Ford's long-term EV transformation timeline
   - Even under pessimistic discount rate assumptions (15%), Investment A remains superior

3. **Risk Considerations**:
   - The longer duration of Investment A provides more opportunities to capture value through multiple business cycles
   - Annual cash flow differential of $10M provides meaningful incremental resources for strategic initiatives

## CONCLUSION & STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Bottom Line Assessment

Ford's 2018 strategic restructuring has proven to be a defining moment in the company's transformation. The segmentation into Blue/Model e/Pro business units enabled Ford to navigate the industry's electrification transition while maintaining **resilient cash generation** and leveraging **strong franchises** (F-Series, Transit, Pro commercial). While profitability remains **cyclical**, the strategic clarity achieved through organizational restructuring positions Ford for sustainable success.

**Key Success Factors for Next Decade:**

1. **Execute the Three-Business Strategy** - Continue optimizing ICE profitability (Blue), scaling EV investments (Model e), and expanding commercial solutions (Pro)
2. **Maintain Strategic Discipline** - Resist temptation to blur business unit boundaries; each requires different metrics and management approaches  
3. **Leverage Segmentation Benefits** - Use organizational clarity to attract targeted talent, partnerships, and capital for each business
4. **Scale Ford Pro Advantage** - Accelerate growth in commercial segment where Ford has sustainable competitive advantages

### Critical Success Factors

For long-term financial health, Ford must:
- Execute EV strategy without destroying near-term profitability
- Maintain discipline in capital allocation
- Preserve strength of core truck/commercial franchises
- Improve structural cost position to compete with new entrants

### Final Investment Decision

**Choose Investment A** - its superior present value, strategic alignment with Ford's transformation timeline, and consistent advantage across all discount rate scenarios make it the clear choice for maximizing shareholder value.
