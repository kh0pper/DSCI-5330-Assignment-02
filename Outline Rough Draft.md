# Assignment 2 â€“ Finance and Accounting 

## Quick Analysis of Ford (2015â€“2024)

### 1\. Revenue & Profitability

* Revenue fluctuated between **$127B (2020 pandemic low)** and **$185B (2024 high)**.

* **Margins are thin**: Operating income rarely exceeds 6â€“7B, and in 2019â€“2020 Ford was barely breakeven or negative.

* **2021 was an outlier**: Net income surged to **17.9B** due to special items (pension remeasurement, investments like Rivian).

*Recommendation:*

* Ford should continue **focusing on higher-margin vehicles** (trucks, SUVs, and commercial) while simplifying low-margin product lines.

* Greater emphasis on **software and service revenue (connected vehicles, subscriptions)** can boost margins beyond the cyclical auto core.

### 2\. Cash Flow & Capex

* **CFO remained strong** most years (15â€“25B range).

* **Capex averaged 6â€“8B annually** â€” heavy EV & restructuring investments.

* **Free Cash Flow (CFO â€“ Capex)** stayed positive except for downturn years, showing Ford can fund investments internally.

*Recommendation:*

* Keep **disciplined Capex allocation** by balancing EV investments with sustaining profitable ICE/Hybrid platforms.

* Increase transparency on **EV ROI milestones** (e.g., break-even timing for Model e) to reassure investors that cash flow is being reinvested effectively.

### 3\. Balance Sheet & Debt

* Total Assets grew from **225B in 2015** to **285B in 2024**.

* **Debt is massive (â‰ˆ150â€“160B)**, but most belongs to Ford Credit, not Automotive.

* **Cash holdings increased** in recent years (25B+), giving liquidity cushion.

*Recommendation:*

* Maintain high cash reserves to offset cyclical swings and fund the EV transition.

* Consider **gradual de-leveraging of Automotive debt** (not Ford Credit), which would strengthen investor confidence without hurting lending operations.

### 4\. Liquidity & Leverage

* **Current ratios hover near 1.0** â€” adequate but not strong.

* **Debt-to-equity looks high (3â€“5x)**, but thatâ€™s inflated by Ford Creditâ€™s financing model.

*Recommendation:*

* Improve liquidity by tightening **working capital management** (inventory, receivables).

* Continue diversifying Ford Credit funding to protect against rising rates or credit market stress.

### 5\. Key Risks & Patterns

* Heavy dependence on **Ford Credit** makes leverage ratios look risky.

* Profitability is very **cyclical**: downturns (2019â€“2020, 2022\) vs. recovery years.

* **EV transition spending** is evident in rising Capex and R\&D.

*Recommendation***:**

* Strengthen **quality control and recall management**, since unexpected costs have historically hurt margins.

* Speed up **EV scale-up** by leveraging Ford Pro (fleets/commercial customers) â€” early adoption here is less price-sensitive than retail.

* Partner strategically on **battery supply and charging infrastructure**, reducing risk of high input costs or adoption bottlenecks.

*Bottom line:* 

Ford has resilient cash generation and strong franchises (F-Series, Transit, Pro commercial). But profitability remains thin and cyclical. To thrive in the next decade, Ford should **optimize margins through product mix and services, carefully manage Capex in EVs, maintain strong cash reserves, and leverage Ford Pro as a stable growth engine.**

### 6\. Problem Restated

* **Investment A:** $50M per year, 20 years

* **Investment B:** $40M per year, 12 years

We need to compare the **Present Value (PV)** of each stream at different discount rates.

 *Formula: PV of an Ordinary Annuity*

PV=C  1-1+r-nr

Where:

* C \= annual cash inflow

* r \= discount rate

* n \= number of years

*Example Calculations*

***Case 1: Discount Rate \= 5%***

* **A:**

PVA=50Ã— 1-1.05-200.05=623.1M

* **B:**

PVB=40Ã— 1-1.05-200.05=354.5M

ðŸ¡ª **A is much larger.**

***Case 2: Discount Rate \= 10%***

* **A:**

PVA=50Ã— 1-1.10-200.10=425.7M

* **B:**

PVB=40Ã— 1-1.10-200.10=272.6M

ðŸ¡ª **A is still larger.**

***Case 3: Discount Rate \= 15%***

* **A:**

PVA=50Ã— 1-1.15-200.15=313.0M

* **B:**

PVB=40Ã— 1-1.15-200.15=202.8M

* **A is still larger.**

*Conclusion*

* Across reasonable discount rates (5%â€“15%), Investment A always has a higher Present Value than Investment B.

* **Choose A** because:

  * It produces **higher annual cash flow ($50M vs $40M)**

  * It lasts **longer (20 years vs 12 years)**

  * Even when discounting heavily, A remains superior.
